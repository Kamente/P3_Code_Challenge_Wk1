## 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time

```
Used to a 24-hour clock and maybe you are having a challenge reading 
a 12-hour clock? Don't worry i got you on this. 
This is a simple python program that converts 12-hour time to 24-hr time. 
Just input the 12-hour time you want to convert and on running the 
code you will be provided with the 24- hour time format 

```

## 2: Returning two positive numbers

```
This python program takes three integer arguments and returns 
true if two of the numbers are positive (>0), else  it returns
false, depending on the user's inputs

```

```

```
